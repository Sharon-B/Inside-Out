# Structure

## Interaction Design 

User interactions will be intuitive and consistent throughout the site to ensure it is easy to use and quick to learn for the user. Clickable links and buttons are used throughout the site to offer the user easy access to pages. They will have a hover effect applied so they are easily identifiable when a user hovers over them. A cursor pointer will appear when hovering over clickable images.

Toast notifications have been used throughout the site to offer the user feedback on their actions for example when adding an item to the cart a success notification will be displayed advising the user that the item has been added to the cart.

## Information Design 

Will allow for the prioritisation of information to be displayed in a clear and concise manner to make it as easy as possible for the user to read and quickly find the information that is most relevant to their needs.
