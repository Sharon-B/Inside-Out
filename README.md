# Structure

## Interaction Design 

User interactions will be intuitive and consistent throughout the site to ensure it is easy to use and quick to learn for the user. Clickable links and buttons are used throughout the site to offer the user easy access to pages. They will have a hover effect applied so they are easily identifiable when a user hovers over them. A cursor pointer will appear when hovering over clickable images.

Toast notifications have been used throughout the site to offer the user feedback on their actions for example when adding an item to the cart a success notification will be displayed advising the user that the item has been added to the cart.

## Information Design 

Will allow for the prioritisation of information to be displayed in a clear and concise manner to make it as easy as possible for the user to read and quickly find the information that is most relevant to their needs.

## Difference between final design and original wireframes

### Home Page

Added a shop all new arrivals call to action button at the end of the new arrivals section.

Added a check out all blog posts call to action button at the end of the latest blog post section.

# Surface

## Typography

PlayFair Display is used for the logo and headings throughout the site as it is well suited for titling and suits the style of the site.

Source Sans Pro is used for all other text content. It is a sans serif typeface that works well in this context and is easily readable.

## Colour scheme

### Logo

![color-palette](https://github.com/Sharon-B/Inside-Out/blob/main/readme-documentation/color-palette/logo-colors.png)

![color-palette](https://github.com/Sharon-B/Inside-Out/blob/main/readme-documentation/color-palette/logo-image.png)

The logo uses two colours blue #0E5CA5 and green #097485, both used due to their association with the outdoors and nature which is appropriate for the theme of this site.

### Rest Of Site

![color-palette](https://github.com/Sharon-B/Inside-Out/blob/main/readme-documentation/color-palette/main-colors.png)

1. Primary Colour - The same blue #0E5CA5 used in the logo was then used as the base for the color of the rest of the site.

# Implementation 

Once the initial concept for the project was decided upon I first developed the wireframes. From these wireframes I then developed the basic database structure required. The initial database diagram can be seen [here](https://github.com/Sharon-B/Inside-Out/blob/main/readme-documentation/inside-out-db-diagram.png)

I then set up the Django framework first by installing Django using:

        pip3 install django

Then I created the project using: 

        django-admin startproject inside-out

I checked the .gitignore file which is automatically created when using the Code Institute template and ensured the following files were added:

        *.sqlite3, *.pyc, __pycache__ and env.py

The environment variables needed to run the project were saved in env.py. I ran the initial migrations using 

        python3 manage.py migrate

I created a superuser using the command:

        python3 manage.py createsuperuser

At this point it is possible to run the server for the first time and check that Django has been installed.

        python3 manage.py runserver

I created requirements.txt for all the dependencies used. I set up a base.html from which my html templates would be extended from. 
The site consists of 7 apps – blog, cart, checkout, contact, home, products and user_profiles. Each app was created using the command 

        python3 manage.py startapp <app_name>

As I added a new app I added it to the list of installed apps and set up its models and register them in the admin.py. Then I would create the initial view which would usually be added to as more functionality was added to the site, add its url path in urls.py and include the url path in the projects main urls.py file. Add forms in forms.py (if needed), and any associated html templates. Django templating language was used to insert the data into the html templates.

## Issues/Solutions

The Stripe card input field was not displaying, after researching why this could be and contacting tutor support I realised it was because I changed some of the styles in the stripe_elements.js file, which were originally from the Stripe website. Once I reverted these styles back to how they were I could then see the Stripe card input, it was as if the changes I made overlapped the original Stripe card input field. I also changed some of the Stripe styling units in checkout.css from px to rem to keep it inline with the rest of the project, this resulted in a warning in the console so I reset them back to px.

Due to a Gitpod issue my Gitpod workspace got stuck in 'building' mode and could not be opened, after much back and forth with Gitpod I had to start a new workspace using the green gitpod button from the GitHub repo. Having started the new workspace I had to re-install all requirements - I could do this using the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, create a new superuser, run all migrations again, and set up my env.py file again. I also had to rebuild the database.

While initially testing the save-info checkbox in the checkout page during development I noticed that even with the save-info box unchecked it was saving the user's delivery details to the user profile over-writing any details that were already saved in the users' profile. While looking into this I found a Slack post by @Philipp which helped me to resolve this issue. In stripe_elements.js where its getting the form data I changed 

    let saveInfo = Boolean($('#id-save-info').attr('checked'));

to

    let saveInfo = $('#id-save-info').is(':checked');

This seems to give a better True/False result for whether the checkbox is checked and whether the data should be saved or not. Then within the webhook_handler.py I changed 

    if save-info:

to 

    if save-info is True:

I was also having another issue where the info being saved to the users profile was being displayed as a tuple instead of a string. Once I made the above changes this issue was also resolved, so needed no further investigation.

After completing the delete_comment() view to delete a comment made on a blog post I was getting a Django 404 error - page not found. No BlogPost matches the given query. This was because I originally had my delete comment url path set to 

    path('delete/<int:comment_id>/', views.delete_comment, name='delete_comment'),

which was very similar to the url path for delete_blog_post, so django wasn't making it past the delete blog post url path to get to the delete comment url path. By changing the delete comment url path to 

    path('comment/delete/<int:comment_id>/', views.delete_comment, name='delete_comment'),

the issue was resolved.

## Known Bugs

On the shopping cart page the quantity select +/- buttons enable/disable appropriately only when the update link is clicked, not when the buttons themselves are clicked. This only happens on larger screen sizes and needs to be further investigated. Due to time restraints this issue is unresolved.

Deleting a product from the database also removes it from previous orders. This is due to the product foreign key in the OrderLineItem Model being set to on_delete=models.CASCADE. While this needs further investigation I think setting this to on_delete=models.PROTECT instead could help resolve the issue. However due to time constraints I have not had time to test this out and so this issue is currently unresolved.

# Defensive Design

* 404.html and 500.html error pages included.
* Only logged in users can access the profile page. If `/profile/` is typed onto the end of the url it redirects to the login page. If users are logged in it redirects to their profile page.
* Only admin superusers have acces to the add product and add blog pages. If `/products/add/` is typed onto the end of the url, non logged in users are redirected to the login page. Logged in users are redirected to the home page with an error message. This is the same for the edit and delete products and blog pages.
* Only the user who made the purchase can access the order history. If the order history url is typed onto the end of the url and it is not their order they are redirected to their profile page with an error message.

# Testing

Testing documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Sharon-B/Inside-Out/blob/main/TESTING.md)

# Deployment

This website was created in the Gitpod development environment. After creating a new repository in GitHub using the Code Institute template, the green Gitpod button was used to initialise the repository in Gitpod. 

Throughout the process the git commands `git add` and `git commit` were used to store the work in the local Gitpod environment, `git push` would then be used to push the commits to the GitHub repository. Branches were used for some of the main features and the following git commands were used:
	
    git branch <new_branch_name>
    git checkout <branch_name>	
    git add
    git commit
    git push origin <branch_name>
    git checkout <main>
    git merge –no-ff <branch_name>
    git push


## Heroku Deployment

1.	Login to Heroku.com and click New -> Create New App

* Add a name
* Select region
* Click Create App

2.	To add the postgres database in Heroku:

In the Resources tab -> Add ons:
*   Search for postgres
*   Select Heroku Postgres
*   Select the free option
*   Click submit

3.	In the gitpod environment install dj_database_url and psycopy2 packages using the commands:

        pip3 install psycopy2-binary

        pip3 install dj_database_url

4.	Freeze these requirements into the requirements.txt file by running the following command:

    pip3 freeze —local > requirements.txt

This will ensure all the dependencies currently used by the app are in the requirements.txt file.

5.	Update the settings.py file by adding:

        import dj_database_url

And setting up the new database settings:

        DATABASES = {
            ‘default’ = dj_databse_url.parse(‘<postgres_url>’)
        }

Comment out the original database setting for now so that we are connected to the postgres database.

6.	Now we need to run migrations for the new postgres database. We can first showmigrations to see that the migrations still need to be applied using

        python3 manage.py showmigrations

When I did this I had an error due to a gitpod issue when connecting to Heroku Postgres, to resolve this I had to run the following command in the CLI:

        Unset PGHOSTADDR

Once all is ok we can show the migrations again and then apply the migrations using:

        python3 manage.py migrate

7.  Create a superuser:

        python3 manage.py createsuperuser

8.	To get the data from the original sqlite database used in Gitpod:

*   Reconnect to the original sqlite database in settings.py
*   Backup the sqlite database and load it into a db.json file using the command:

        ./manage.py dumpdata --exclude auth.permission --exclude contenttypes --indent 2 > db.json

* Then connect back to the postgres database in settings.py 
* Load the data from the db.json file into the postgres database using the command:

        ./manage.py loaddata db.json

9.	Then we can run the site using the postgres database however I encountered an error here and had to do the following:

* In terminal I entered: `echo $DATABASE_URL`
* The response in the terminal was: postgresql://gitpod@localhost
* Then in the terminal I entered: `unset DATABASE_URL`

This is another gitpod issue with the code institute template and was because Gitpod sets postgresql://gitpod@localhost and it is not a valid Postgres URL (no name), so it throws an error.

10.	Setup settings.py file to use either the sqlite database when running on gitpod or the postgres database when running on Heroku by using the following code:

        If 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
	
            DATABASES = {
                'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
            }
	
	    else:
	
            DATABASES = {
                'default': {
                    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                    'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
                }
            }

Ensuring the DATABASE_URL environment variable is set in the Heroku config vars.

11.	 Install gunicorn which acts as our webserver:

    pip3 install gunicorn

And then:

    pip3 freeze —local > requirements.txt

To save it in the requirements.txt file.

12.	Create a Procfile and add the following code to it which tells Heroku to create a web dyno which will run gunicorn and serve our app.

        Web: gunicorn <app_name>.wsgi:application

13.	 We will initially disable collectstatic in Heroku, this can be done in the cli:

* Heroku login -i
* Enter Heroku login details
* And run:

        Heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1

14.	 Update allowed hosts in settings.py to 

        ALLOWED_HOSTS = [‘<heroku_app_name>.herokuapp.com’, ‘localhost’]


15.	Git add, git commit and git push files to GitHub so they are available to Heroku which will use them to build the app.


16.	 Initialise the Heroku git remote in the CLI:

    Heroku git:remote -a <heroku_app_name>

17.	 Push to Heroku:

    git push Heroku main

The app is now deployed via Heroku.

18.	In Heroku we can now set up automatic deployments so that each time the code is pushed to github it also deploys to Heroku. In the deploy tab:

* Select Connect to GitHub, when the Github profile is displayed add the name of your repo and click search, once it finds & displays the correct repo click connect.
* Select the branch the repo is using
* Click Enable Automatic Deploys

19.	In Heroku Config Vars set up a SECRET_KEY.

### Manual deployment:

In the manual deployment section:

* Click Deploy Branch => Your app was successfully deployed will be displayed with the option to view the app.

### Creating A Local Clone

You can clone the repository to create a local copy on your computer.
From the Git Hub repository:

* Click Code at the top of the file list
* Click the clipboard icon to copy the url provided

Open terminal:

* Change the current working directory to where you want the cloned directory to be
* Type git clone and paste the copied url after it
* Press enter and the clone will be created
